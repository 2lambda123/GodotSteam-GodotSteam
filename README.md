Known Issues
----------
- The GDNative version does not allow for default arguments in functions, thus some functions may have odd behaviors.  If you are using this version of GodotSteam you are required to pass any argument that has a default in the module version. Also, there are no enums in the GDNative version due to how it is structured.
- Getting lobby lists returns a non-array response despite being coded for an array.

Quick How-To
----------
Obtain the plugin through one of two ways:
- Visit the Godot Asset Library either through the website or in the editor and search for GodotSteam.
- Download this repo and unzip it into the base of your game project.

Go into **Project > Settings > Plugins** and activate the plugin.

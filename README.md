Current Build
----------
You can [download pre-compiled versions _(currently v3.5.1)_ of this repo here](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/releases).

**Version 3.6 Changes**
- Changed: brought the plug-in version up to speed with the module version

Known Issues
----------
- The GDNative version does not allow for default arguments in functions, thus some functions may have odd behaviors.  If you are using this version of GodotSteam you are required to pass any argument that has a default in the module version. Also, there are no enums in the GDNative version due to how it is structured.
- Getting lobby lists returns a non-array response despite being coded for an array.

Quick How-To
----------
For complete instructions on how to build the GDNative version of GodotSteam, [please refer to our documentation 'How-To GDNative'](https://godotsteam.com/howto_gdnative/)  It will have the most up-to-date information.

Usage
----------
Do not use the GDNative version of GodotSteam with any of the module versions whether it be our pre-compiled versions or ones you compile.  They are not compatible with each other.

When exporting with the GDNative version, please use the normal Godot Engine templates instead of our GodotSteam templates or you will have a lot of issues.

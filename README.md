Current Build
---
This is not functional currently.  This branch is serving as a starting point for making the GDExtension version functional.  Currently it does not compile as the SConstruct file needs tweaking; though most of the actual GodotSteam stuff is completed.  Please feel free to make changes and submit pull requests!

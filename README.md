# GodotSteam Server for Godot 3.x
Steam Server API for the Godot game engine (versions 3 to 3.1.1). For the Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms. 

Additional flavors include: [Godot 2.x](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/tree/godot2), [Godot 2.x Minimal](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/tree/godot2-min), [Godot 3.x](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/tree/master), [Godot 3.x Minimal](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/tree/godot3-min), and [GDNative](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/tree/gdnative).

**This is experimental still, do not use for production games.**  This branch is meant for testing out Steam server functionality before being folded into the main GodotSteam branches.  Please feel free to make pull requests and/or test what is here.

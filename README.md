Version 4.2 Changes

- Changed: code so it works like a singleton / module
- Changed: brought this version up-to-speed with the 4.x module version
- Fixed: weird issues with uint8/uint16 bindings

Known Issues
---
- Overlay will not work in the editor but will work in export projects when uploaded to Steam.  This seems to a limitation with Vulkan currently.

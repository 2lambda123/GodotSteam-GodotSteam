Current Build
----------
You can [download pre-compiled versions _(currently v3.5.1)_ of this repo here](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/releases).

**Version 3.5.1 Changes:**
- Changed: createSteamID function to use proper 64-bit int
- Changed: brought the plug-in version up to speed with the module version
- Changed: output from subscribe_item, unsubscribe_item file_id to uint64_t
- Fixed: some new compiling quirks
- Removed: setIdentitySteamID and getIdentitySteamID

**Version 3.5 Changes:**
- Fixed: incorrect type for getAppListBuildId

Known Issues
----------
- The GDNative version does not allow for default arguments in functions, thus some functions may have odd behaviors.  If you are using this version of GodotSteam you are required to pass any argument that has a default in the module version. Also, there are no enums in the GDNative version due to how it is structured.

Quick How-To
----------
Obtain the plugin through one of two ways:
- Visit the Godot Asset Library either through the website or in the editor and search for GodotSteam.
- Download this repo and unzip it into the base of your game project.
- Create a file called **steam_appid.txt** and put it next to your editor. This file will need either 480 or your game's app ID in it as the only text.

Go into **Project > Settings > Plugins** and activate the plugin.

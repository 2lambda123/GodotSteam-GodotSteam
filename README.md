Known Issues
---
- Overlay will not work in the editor but will work in export projects when uploaded to Steam.  This seems to a limitation with Vulkan currently.

Quick How-To
---
For complete instructions on how to build the GDExtension version of GodotSteam, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To GDExtension' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto_gdextension/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Alternatively, you can just [download the pre-compiled versions in our Releases section](https://github.com/Gramps/GodotSteam/releases) or [from the Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1768) and skip compiling it yourself!

Usage
----------
Do not use the GDExtension version of GodotSteam with any of the module versions whether it be our pre-compiled versions or ones you compile.  They are not compatible with each other.

When exporting with the GDExtension version, please use the normal Godot Engine templates instead of our GodotSteam templates or you will have a lot of issues.
